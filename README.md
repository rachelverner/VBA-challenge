Overview of Script
Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

Added the rows and column headers for the two new tables
Add the list of stocks to column I
Populate the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume columns
Other calculations
Find the first and last row for each stock symbol
Added an If statement to avoid a division by zero error
Table 3, from columns O through Q
Use Max and Min to find the stock with the greatest increase and decrease, and the greatest volume
Find the stock with the greatest total volume
Use Match to find the stock symbol for each of those three metrics
